Provided extensions:
	org.jboss.tools.m2e.extras.genericSourceConfigurator
		Adds support for generic source generating plugins.  Provides:
			Executes the plugin during full builds (i.e. no incremental support)
			Refreshes the output folder used by the plugin.  The output folder
				property used by the plugin can be configured within the
				lifecycle mapping configuration.
			Source folders are configured based on the execution phase:
				*-sources phases are configured as source folders.
				*-resources phases are configured as resource folders.
			Build output folders are configured based on the execution phase:
				*-test-* are configured for output to test build output.
				other folders are configured for normal build output. 
		Limitations:
			Does not scan input folders, hence no support for incremental builds.
			Does not provide any support for "clean."  Output folders must be
				cleaned using mvn clean.

	org.jboss.tools.m2e.extras.dependencyUnpackConfigurator
		Adds support for dependency:unpack goal.
			Behavior is similar to that of the genericSourceConfigurator.

	org.jboss.tools.m2e.extras.dependencyCopyDependenciesConfigurator
			*Note, this extension does not function correctly.
		Adds support for dependency:copy-dependencies goal.  Provides:
			Executes plugin during full builds (i.e. no incremental support).
			Refreshes output folders used by the plugin.
			Can be configured to have copied dependencies added to build
				classpath using the "configureClasspath" setting in the
				lifecycle mapping configuration.
